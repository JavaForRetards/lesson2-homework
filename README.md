# Assignment 2: Array sorting
The homework for the second lesson was deliberately complicated. My reasoning was that having you repeat just precisely what I just taught you, in a brainless way, would be a waste of our time. You can do that on your own. It matters little that you just learned about this stuff: programming is not about memorising things.

I never expected you to independently discover sorting algorithms rivaling those conceived by the most brilliant computer scientists of the past century: I simply wanted you to have a shot at it. It really matters little whether you succeeded, as long as you learned to dabble with the building blocks I provided to try and solve a complicated task. Any of you that came up with a reasonable solution with as little knowledge as you have may have a future as algorithm designers, to be honest.

Programming is about problem-solving, and about applying logic to it. So, let's see those at work.

Use whatever knowledge you gathered in the lesson to solve the following problem.

1. Take as input 5 positive integers, lower than 10, and store them in an array.
2. If an invalid number (i.e. a String, or a value lower than 1 or higher than 9) is given, print an error and ask again.
3. For each array member, print out its number name (i.e. "one" for 1, "two" for 2, "three" for 3, etcetera).
4. Create a new array, of the same size, and store into it the numbers of the old array, sorted from lowest to highest.
